Prompt:

Problem 1:
Read the strings entered by the user and print the largest line among them.

Problem 2:
What is the output for the following code? printf("Hello World" + 4);
What would be the output of the following C program?

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
	int i=43;
	printf("%d",printf("%d",printf("%d",i)));
	return 0;
