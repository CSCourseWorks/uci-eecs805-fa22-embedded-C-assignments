Prompt:

Step 1
You have a SOC which has a temperature sensor. The temperature value is stored in an 8-bit memory-mapped register. Assume the address of this register is 0x417164. Values 0x00 to 0x7F are for temperatures above freezing and 0x80 to 0xFF for below freezing, in Centigrade.

Step 2
Initialize the register with a positive temperature value

Step 3
Create a polling routine that displays the temperature value. If the temperature value entered is below zero, then display " Freezing".3.4 Now change the register value to a negative value and rerun the program.
